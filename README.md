# Quiz Platform

This is a simple **Quiz Platform** built using **React.js** that allows users to attempt quizzes on various subjects, track their progress, and view their final score at the end. The platform fetches quiz questions from a public API and presents them interactively. Users can select a subject, attempt the quiz, and get immediate feedback on their score.

## Features

- **Subject Selection**: Users can choose a subject from a list of available quiz topics.
- **Quiz Attempt**: The user can answer multiple-choice questions in a quiz and track their progress.
- **Real-time Progress**: While attempting the quiz, the user can see their current progress.
- **Scoreboard**: Once the quiz is completed, the user receives a score based on their answers.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works across all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **API**: Public Quiz API (e.g., [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php))
